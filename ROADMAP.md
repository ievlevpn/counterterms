# Roadmap

Where `regstruct` is going. Phases mirror [`notes/architecture.md`](notes/architecture.md) §7;
the mathematics and conventions are fixed in [`notes/initial_plan.md`](notes/initial_plan.md).
Legend: ✅ done · 🔨 in progress · ⬜ planned.

## Phase 1 — equation pipeline ✅

**Goal:** `SPDE → family of renormalized equations` with free symbolic constants. No Hopf
coproducts (the family-with-free-constants needs only rule → trees → `S(τ)` → `F(τ*)`).

- [x] `core/` — ordered-ring homogeneities (`ℚ⊕ℚκ`), jet variables, the `Signature`
- [x] `trees/` — decorated trees, canonical form, `S(τ)`, homogeneity
- [x] `equation/` — SymPy DSL, rule derivation from the nonlinearity, tree enumeration
- [x] `renorm/` — the Υ map `F(τ*)`, the `RenormalizedEquation` output
- [x] golden test (gKPZ, exact 5 counterterms) + KPZ/gPAM + scope rejections

**Acceptance (met):** the gKPZ family reproduces tourist_guide.tex 6004–6012 exactly,
including the factor-2 and `S=2` cases; KPZ lands on the table's 6 negative-homogeneity rows.

---

## Phase 2 — generality ✅

**Goal:** widen the input class with (mostly) `Signature` enrichment + validation; little new
algorithmic structure, by design.

- [x] **Systems / vector unknowns** — multiple components sharing spacetime coords; each child
      **edge carries the component** `𝔗_e` of the kernel that plants it (node types stay
      `{●, ∘_j}`). The elementary differential threads the child equation index from the edges
      (`F_a(τ*) = (Πᵢ F_{cᵢ}(τ_i*))·(D^n Πᵢ ∂_{(cᵢ,p_i)}) F_a(b*)`), and **constants are shared
      across components** (one `k_τ` per tree, weighting each equation's vector field).
- [x] **Multiple noises** — one `∘_j` node type per noise; base map `{●:g, ∘_j:f_{a,j}}`.
- [x] **General operator order** — per-component Schauder order `m` carried into the homogeneity
      recursion (`|I^{(c)}_p τ| = |τ| + (m_c − |p|_𝔰)`), with a warning outside the proven
      second-order parabolic regime. *(Global scaling; genuinely mixed scalings stay out of scope.)*
- [x] Tests: decoupled system reduces to per-component gKPZ; coupled system shares constants;
      multi-noise (8 counterterms); operator order changes the homogeneities.

**Acceptance (met):** a 2-component system and a 2-noise equation produce the correct coupled
counterterms; the decoupled system reproduces the scalar gKPZ result per component; scalar
single-noise results are unchanged (regression green).

> Moved to Phase 3: the **`G⁻` vs `G⁻_ad` toggle**. Admissibility is genuinely a model
> (K-admissibility) notion — the paper's own gKPZ example is stated for `k∈G⁻_ad` yet keeps the
> decorated `∘1` primitive, so a naive "drop `X^n⋆σ`" filter would be wrong. We emit the full free
> family (the safe superset) until the structures exist to characterise `G⁻_ad` precisely.

## Phase 3 — the algebraic-renormalization core 🔨

**Goal:** build the genuine regularity-structures machinery. This is the famous-hard part.
Modules: `trees/coproducts.py`, `structures.py` (`core/hopf.py` generic layer still TODO).

- [x] **Extended-decoration trees** — red nodes with `𝔬 ∈ ℤ[β₀]` (reusing `Homogeneity`); the
      contraction `τ /^red φ`, `extended_homogeneity`. (`trees/tree.py`)
- [x] **Extraction-contraction `δ⁻`** (`Δ⁻`, tex 5636) + the group coproduct, **coassociative**
      (`(δ⁻⊗id)δ⁻ = (id⊗δ⁻)δ⁻`). Golden `δ∘ = 𝟙₋⊗∘ + ∘⊗●(β₀)`; stability invariants.
- [x] **Recentering `Δ`/`Δ⁺`** (tex 5613) + **comodule coassociativity**
      `(Δ⊗id)Δ = (id⊗Δ⁺)Δ`, `Δ⁺` coassociativity, counits, homogeneity stability.
- [x] **Negative twisted antipode `S'₋`** (tex 5034); `S'₋(∘) = −∘`.
- [x] **`δ⁺` (`D̄⁻`)** + the **cointeraction** `(id⊗Δ)δ = M¹³(δ⊗δ⁺)Δ` — **holds for the gKPZ
      class (β₀=−1) AND the singular β₀=−3/2 trees**. Fix: the e'-Taylor recentering runs over
      the full extraction boundary `∂(A,F)` (between-component edges too, not only φ→outside),
      and edges below a pre-existing red node stay internal. See
      [`notes/cointeraction_singular_noise.md`](notes/cointeraction_singular_noise.md) §8.
- [x] **Structures** — `RenormalizationStructure` (`δ`, `δ⁻`, `S'₋`) + the **symbolic BHZ
      character** `k = h∘S'₋` (`h` left symbolic). (`structures.py`)
- [ ] **Generic Hopf layer** (`core/hopf.py`, over the `Symbol` protocol) — character
      convolution, connected-graded antipode, comodule action `k̃`. (currently tree-specific)
- [x] **`RegularityStructure (T, T⁺)`** — γ-bounded model basis (`generate_trees`, positive
      sector included), graded by homogeneity; `Δ : T → T⁺`, `Δ⁺` on `T⁺`; tested graded +
      triangular into `T⁺`, with the divergent subspace = the counterterms. (`structures.py`)
- [ ] **Rule completion** (BHZ Prop 5.21) — replace the generate-then-filter shortcut.
- [ ] **`G⁻` vs `G⁻_ad` toggle** (moved from Phase 2) — reduce the free family to `G⁻_ad`.

**Acceptance:** coassociativities + cointeraction (incl. singular β₀=−3/2) green as property
tests over the SPDE corpus; `S'₋` validated on small trees. **112 tests pass (~4s).**

---

## Phase 4 — deferred seams (optional) ⬜

**Goal:** the boundaries we intentionally left without implementations.

- [ ] **`NoiseLaw` + canonical BPHZ values** — Gaussian/Wick expectations to evaluate
      `h^ζ(τ) = 𝔼[Π^ζ τ](0)` and hence the canonical `k_τ` (needs covariance kernels / integrals).
- [ ] **da Prato–Debussche pre-pass** — handle `β₀ ≤ −2` (Φ⁴₂, Φ⁴₃, sine-Gordon) by introducing
      one noise symbol per power to lift into a `β₀ > −2` structure.
- [ ] **Multi-index symbol basis** — a second `Symbol` implementation (Linares–Otto–Tempelmayr)
      plugging into the same generic algebra, validating the basis seam.
- [ ] **Analytic / numerical export** — emit a built structure (trees, homogeneities, coproducts)
      for an external analytic or numerical consumer.

## Output & rendering 🔨

**Goal:** emit *all useful information* — the renormalized family, and **every divergent tree**
drawn nicely — across terminal / LaTeX / Markdown / JSON. Full spec, information inventory, tree
notation, and report layout in [`notes/output.md`](notes/output.md). Principle: reuse SymPy's
pretty/LaTeX printers; we own only the **tree** drawer and the report assembler. No new runtime
dep (`forest` is a `.tex` concern; ANSI colour is `isatty`-gated; `rich` only if asked).

- [x] **O1 (with Phase 1, now):** `render/tree.py` — three faithful renderings of a
      `DecoratedTree`: linear shorthand (`●·𝓘ₓ[Ξ]²`), 2D terminal drawing, LaTeX `forest`. A
      `render/report.py` text/markdown report covering inventory items 1–15 (echoed SPDE, domain,
      noise regularities, derived rule, the `𝓑_{<0}` table sorted by `|τ|` in the exact `ℚ+ℚκ`
      order, the assembled family). `summary()` now shares the prettifier. The full `𝓑_<0`
      (incl. `F(τ*)=0` non-contributors) is on `eq.all_trees`. *(D2 produces no zero-F trees in
      current scope, so "0 dropped" — the slot is wired and labelled for when red nodes arrive.)*
- [x] **O2:** `render/latex.py` — standalone `pdflatex`-ready document; JSON export (`to_json`,
      the clean handoff at the symbolic boundary).
- [ ] **O3 (with Phase 3):** wire the algebra section — pretty-print `Δτ`, `Δ⁻τ`, `S'₋τ` as
      tree⊗tree sums (pure reuse of the O1 tree drawer) and the structure's homogeneity spectrum.
- [ ] **O4 (with Phase 4):** the canonical-values column — replace each free `k_τ` with its BPHZ
      value once a `NoiseLaw` exists.

**Acceptance:** the gKPZ report reproduces the five trees and their homogeneity ordering; one
assert-based `demo()` per renderer is the backbone check.

## Cross-cutting (ongoing) ⬜

- [ ] Performance: memoize `F(τ*)` and `S(τ)` by canonical key once tree sets grow.
- [ ] Packaging/CI: lockfile, lint, a CI run of `uv run pytest`.
